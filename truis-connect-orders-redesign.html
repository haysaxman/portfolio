      <h2>Truis Connect Renewals Redesign</h2> 
      <p>
        Truis Connect is a customer portal used by customers and staff of Truis to track and manage
        their orders, assets, renewals and health of their systems. After Truis rebranded, and with
        progress being made towards an e-commerce platform, Truis saw it was a priority to update
        their orders page on Truis Connect. This brought it in-line with their new look, providing a
        better overall user experience as their e-commerce release brings more traffic to the portal.
        The target audience are IT Managers of small to medium sized businesses who are typically
        people who are the first point of contact for our business and any deals made. My role in the
        project is a UX/UI Designer as well as a Front-end Developer. The challenge with this project
        was our lack of human resources, therefore I had to take on two roles during the project
        lifecycle.

        <h3>
          Interviews
        </h3>
        <p>
          I started the project with interviewing stakeholders such as management, customer support
          and also regular users of the existing Orders page. I contacted around 12 customers and
          managed to organise four interviews with customers who have used the platform before.
          Unfortunately I had to wait a couple weeks between organising and conducting the
          interviews, so in the mean time I began the low fidelity designs.

        <h3>Low fidelity designs</h3>
        <p>
          I started sketching ideas that were highlighted during staff interviews for the existing page.
          This allowed me to improve existing concepts, as well as the hierarchy and layout to provide
          better user experience. I constantly got feedback from the stakeholders and iterated on the
          designs further. I had enough time before the interviews were scheduled that I began to
          design higher fidelity designs in Figma.

        <h3>High fidelity designs</h3>
        <p>
          Using a Bootstrap template in Figma I quickly made high quality renders of my sketches
          which looked closer to the end product. With my experience with Figma it was easy to set up
          components to allow for quick adjustments to multiple elements at a time. These designs
          were continuously improved on from the stakeholder input.

        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p>
          Conveniently, we already had a persona completed by the Marketing Team around our
          target audience (IT Managers), thus I used this research as the majority of customer portal
          users was this target audience.

        <h3>Interaction map</h3>
        <p>
          I created an interaction map to better understand the flow of the user interactions to help
          streamline and to make sure the prototype accounts for everything.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Interactive Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          Using the high fidelity prototype created in Figma I was easily able to put together an
          interactive prototype that stakeholders could test to get more in-depth feedback.

      <h2>Outcomes and lessons</h2> 
      <p>
        Post release feedback was received well and got only a small amount of suggestions for
        improvement. This was mostly around adding more data fields and changing how the
        statuses worked based on customer service processes. Unfortunately, there was a lack of
        tracking and quantitative feedback data. To rectify this, I tried looking on Google analytics for
        valuable insights, but because Truis Connect has no home page and first loads the Orders
        page, the data was skewed. If I were to do this project again with more time and resources, I
        would have researched more upfront before commencing the design process, interviewed
        more customers and also conducted testing with users that weren't already stakeholders.
        Overall, this page design was a big step forward for the user experience design for Truis
        Connect to align it with the new brand.
