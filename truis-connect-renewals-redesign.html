      <h1>Truis Connect Renewals Redesign</h1> 
      <p>
        Truis Connect is a customer portal used by customers and staff of Truis to track and manage
        their orders, assets, renewals and health of their systems. After the Orders page redesign was
        completed, the update was for the Renewals page as management wanted to utilise it to
        increase the number of leads. The current Renewals database had many inaccuracies which
        created a loss of trust from staff and customers alike. The target audience are IT Managers of
        small to medium sized businesses who are typically the first point of contact for our business
        and any deals made. My role in the project is a UX/UI Designer as well as a Front-end
        Developer. The challenge with this project was our lack of human resources, therefore I had to
        take on two roles during the project lifecycle.

        <h2>Process plan</h2>
        <p>
          For this project I pushed for having a bigger focus on the design stage of the project by
          creating a concise project plan, outlining the process of the design, the goal for each stage
          and what had to be done.

          <h2>Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            I first planned a few interviews with the internal staff and customers that frequently use the
            existing Renewals page. Unfortunately, customers were too busy or not comfortable with
            being interviewed, so instead I interviewed our IT Manager as a stand-in as they perform the
            same role internally as our target audience. Although this may have created some bias and
            a smaller sample size, it was a better alternative than no data collected.

        <h2>User Persona</h2>
        <p>
          Using the existing user persona created from the marketing team, I included goals and
          frustrations of the target audience that were discovered from previous customer interviews
          from our own IT Manager.

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
        <p>
          I took goals from the persona and explored how the user would go about achieving their
          goals using the existing renewals page. This outlined many common drawbacks and
          highlighted points of focus that needed improvement. From this, I then could define the key
          problems with the existing Renewals: Lack of user agency, data inconsistency and lack of
          meaningful organisation.

        <h2>Contextual Reviews</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I explored how other websites and apps went about managing their renewals. With
          these new perspectives I had a wider range of apps and websites that I could draw
          inspiration from. I used these platforms and took notes on what made them efficient or not
          user friendly and why, with the intention to be more informed in my own designs.

        <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p>
          I brought the Development team together to a white board and we worked together to come
          up with ideas for a redesign of the Renewals page. We used ideas from the contextual
          reviews and the interviews to highlight opportunities to improve our own platform.

        <h2>User Flow Diagram</h2>
        <p>
          With the key features we outlined in the brainstorming I explored the steps a user could take
          to complete all of the possible tasks and their goals. I made multiple iterations of each
          process and then discussed with the team to determine the best flow.

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          I iterated on wireframes using Figma that incorporated all the task flows, colouring it based on
          hierarchy of information. Later as I developed the wire frames, I also began to look at the visual
          hierarchy to ensure the user understands the difference between sections and to focus on the
          important elements of each section.

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>High fidelity design</h2>
        <p>
          To save on time we acquired a bootstrap theme which combined multiple JavaScript plugins
          that allowed for easy building of a basic and interactive page based on the wireframes.
          When the design was iterated on further, it would be explored as a wireframe, reviewed and
          then put together in HTML.

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>User testing</h2>
        <p>
          Internal user testing was done frequently to discover bugs and design flaws to iterate on the
          design and improve the overall user experience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Outcomes and lessons</h2> 
        <p>
          As of writing this the Renewals redesign is still in-progress therefore the success of the
          redesign cannot be reviewed. One of the main issues with the original Renewals page was the
          data inaccuracy. This is an issue that comes from the automated process that creates
          renewals from deal records. To solve this we an designed and developed an admin page for
          a chosen staff member to valid the data before creating each renewal. Having spent more
          time on the design process I am more confident that it improves the user experience. If I
          could start this project again, I would have focused more on creating design docs that gave
          diagrams and flows visually for myself to follow more closely during development and to not
          lose sight of the core ideas.
